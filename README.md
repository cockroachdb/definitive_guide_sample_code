# Sample code for CockroachDB The Definitive Guide

This repo contains the sample code for the OReilly book [CockroachDB The Definitive Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cockroachdb-the-definitive/9781098100230/).

## Caveats and tedious disclaimers

The code in this repository is offered in the public domain with No Strings Attached.  You are free to use the code without attribution in any manner whatsoever. 

However, this code is made available for educational purposes only, and we don't assert that it is suitable for inclusion in any production systems or definitively correct.  If your hair falls out or your significant other leaves you after using this code, it's not our fault!

More seriously, this code illustrates CockroachDB coding practices - sometimes including anti-patterns.  In other words, some of these files are examples of WHAT NOT TO DO.  You need to consult the appropriate sections of the book to determine which examples are best-practice and which are anti-patterns.

The authors of these code samples believe that they know something about CockroachDB, but are not necessarily experts in all programming languages or platforms.  Consequently, the idioms and conventions used within language or platform-specific examples might not represent all best practices for that language.

A lot of the code was written by [Guy Harrison](mailto:guy.a.harrison@gmail.com).  Please address any comments or issues to him.
